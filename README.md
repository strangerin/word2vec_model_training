# word2vec_model_training
Wiki dump w2v model training repo

# Requirements were gathered with pip-tools
Could have been poetry or any other manager of your choice. 
I just strongly dislike conda and its derivatives

# NB!
scipy==1.10.1, otherwise it will cause compatibility issues.
Other than that -> pip freeze, should work.

# Dataset preparation time
It will take a long time to download file (approx. 20GB), and to process it 
- a few hours on average CPU.
